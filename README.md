The purpose of this document is to simplify session management and the ability to have a stateful datastore or Near Real Time stream (i.e. Supabase services) tethered to a Sign in with Solana connection.

## Getting started
1. Set up a Supabase Database Project
2. Run in the supabase/* migration and schema against the new database
3. Add a client/.env file (for local development) referencing the variables in .example.env
4. Take a poke around and understand it..
5. Run it locally: 
   1. >> cd client
   2. >> npm install
   3. >> npm run dev 
6. Push it to vercel and add environment variables as per #3
